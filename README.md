Just a simple express app to profile the speeds of the React version of Pvjs and the old version (used in WikiPathways 
at time of writing).


# Usage
1) Clone this repo
2) run `npm start`
3) Go to `localhost:3000/test/new/<PATHWAY_ID>` (no WP in ID) to see a test of the new (React Pvjs)
4) Go to `localhost:3000/test/old/<PATHWAY_ID` to see tests of the old Pvjs
